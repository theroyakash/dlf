# Deep Learning as a Framework (dlf)

Python based deep learning package that provides all basic implementations for popular deep learning and machine learning algorithms.

Our Package will allow user to quickly setup and use popular deep learning algorithms and not to worry about finding implementation online or doing that manually.

# What?
We didn't develop a framework from scratch, but we provide pre-built models on top of built from scratch models so that people just could import and use them.
